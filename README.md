My personal website and portfolio of sorts. 

## What did I use to make this?

* Good ole' HTML & CSS 
* A pinch of jQuery & Javascript
* Materialize 
* SVG (For that super cute laptop + coffee graphic at the end)
* [Github-Calendar](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-calendar#installation) to display my github contribution graph.
